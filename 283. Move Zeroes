/* the most important is that we have a tag, if the value is 0, we make the index of array moves, but the tag does not move
and make array[tag]=array[i]; at last we fill in all the empty spaces with 0
There are two things that should be kept in mind
1. only string corresponds to length(); others' length is regarded as a method, just length
2.the second for loop, the beginning of i is temp rather than temp+1; since you have added 1 in the first loop;
