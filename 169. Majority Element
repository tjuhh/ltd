/*
There are several things needed to pay attention to.
1.upper index and bottom index
if length is an even number;
for example 6; it needs more than 3 same elements, which is four
the idex of the  last element you need to check is 2; which is length/2-1
if length is an odd number;
for example 5;it needs more than 2 same elements, which is 3;
the index of the last element you need to check is 2 ,which is length/2;
Thus if you want to put it together, the index limit should be less than len/2+1;
Further more;
if I write like this;
if(nums[i]==nums[len/2+i])
          
         return nums[i];
         it will say missing return statement;
         
         Sometimes if it says illegal start of the type in the return line; basically you misplaced the brace
